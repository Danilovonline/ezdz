Ezdz [izy-dizy]
===============

This is the fork of the project [Ezdz [izy-dizy]](https://github.com/jaysalvat/ezdz).

Ezdz is a jQuery plugin to turn any standard input type file into a nice drag & drop zone with validators and previews.

Ezdz uses HTML5 [File](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/), [Drag and Drop](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/dnd.html) API, so it works properly on modern browsers only. I've tested it on last version of Chrome, Firefox and Safari on MacOSX and IOS7 safari mobile only. Feedbacks are welcomed.
